Code guidelines are typically a matter of religion.  However, we have to 
agree on something so here goes.

Wherever possible, we will follow the Microsoft Internal Coding Guidelines 
http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/articles/361363.aspx.

Not that these are gospel, but they're as good a guideline as any.  If 
we get a tiny bit sloppy, that's fine. This is not a gestapo.  But please 
try to maintain the style of the existing project.

Also try to keep the FxCop warnings to a minimum.

Project structure should generally follow the guidelines outlined in 
this document, Team Development with Visual Studio.NET and Visual 
SourceSafe (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_app.asp).

For example, 3rd party assemblies should be placed in a folder named 
ExternalDependencies and added to the CVS repository as part of the 
VS.NET solution.  This way, a new developer should be able to get lastest 
and build the project without problems.

Please keep "bin" and "obj" folders as well as *.user and *.suo files OUT of 
CVS by making sure to use the CVS Ignore command.

We will be using NUnit and NAnt at some point, but maybe not NAnt just yet. ;)
